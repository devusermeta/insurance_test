# Communication Agent Integration Summary

## üéâ Successfully Implemented Communication Agent for Insurance Workflow

### ‚úÖ What We Accomplished

1. **Created Communication Agent Structure**
   - `insurance_agents/agents/communication_agent/`
   - Full A2A protocol integration
   - Azure Communication Services integration
   - Graceful error handling

2. **Azure Communication Services Setup**
   - Created Azure Communication Services resource in Captain-Planaut resource group
   - Configured email domain: `DoNotReply@180e132e-1599-4114-a2a3-106949afed2b.azurecomm.net`
   - Set up connection string and environment variables
   - Target email: `purohitabhinav2001@gmail.com`

3. **A2A Protocol Integration** 
   - Communication Agent runs on port 8005
   - Advertises `/.well-known/agent.json` endpoint (NOT /health or /execute)
   - Provides `send_claim_notification` skill
   - Discoverable by orchestrator via A2A protocol

4. **Orchestrator Integration**
   - Modified `intelligent_orchestrator.py` to call Communication Agent
   - Added email notification in `_finalize_workflow_decision()`
   - Workflow continues gracefully if email fails (no system halt)
   - External agent demonstration as requested

### üîß Key Technical Details

**A2A Protocol Endpoints:**
- ‚úÖ `/.well-known/agent.json` - Agent discovery and capabilities
- ‚ùå `/health` and `/execute` - These don't exist in A2A protocol

**Agent Communication Flow:**
1. Orchestrator discovers agents via A2A protocol
2. Communication Agent advertises email notification skill
3. Orchestrator calls Communication Agent when claim decision is final
4. Email sent using Azure Communication Services
5. Workflow continues regardless of email success/failure

**Environment Configuration:**
```bash
AZURE_COMMUNICATION_CONNECTION_STRING=endpoint=https://claim-assist.unitedstates.communication.azure.com/;accesskey=...
AZURE_COMMUNICATION_SENDER_EMAIL=DoNotReply@180e132e-1599-4114-a2a3-106949afed2b.azurecomm.net
```

### üß™ Testing Results

All tests passing:
- ‚úÖ Azure Communication Services configuration
- ‚úÖ A2A protocol discovery working
- ‚úÖ Communication Agent integration verified
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator pattern validated
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling confirmed

### üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start Communication Agent:**
   ```bash
   cd insurance_agents
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate
   $env:PYTHONPATH = "D:\Metakaal\insurance\insurance_agents"

   ```

2. **Run Complete Workflow:**
   - Start all other agents (orchestrator, intake, document, coverage)
   - Process insurance claims through the system
   - Email notifications will be sent automatically when claims are decided
   - System continues working even if Communication Agent is not available

‚öñÔ∏è Coverage Rules Engine - Complete Deep Dive
üìÅ File Structure & Purpose
The Coverage Rules Engine consists of 5 key files:

1. __main__.py - A2A Server Entry Point
Purpose: Sets up the A2A server infrastructure for the coverage rules engine.

Key Features:

Runs on port 8004 (configurable)
Uses the fixed executor (CoverageRulesExecutorFixed)
Defines 4 core skills: Coverage Evaluation, Policy Analysis, Rules Execution, Decision Engine


2. coverage_rules_executor_fixed.py - A2A Compatible Business Logic (202 lines)
Purpose: The main A2A-compatible executor that handles rule processing.

Key Responsibilities:

A2A Protocol Implementation - Inherits from AgentExecutor
Rule-Based Decision Making - Applies business rules to claims
Coverage Calculation - Calculates covered amounts, deductibles
Eligibility Determination - Decides approve/deny based on rules



3. coverage_rules_executor.py - Duplicate of Fixed Version
Purpose: Identical to the fixed version (backup/alternative)

4. coverage_rules_agent.py - FastAPI Alternative Implementation
Purpose: Comprehensive FastAPI-based implementation with full business logic.



5. __init__.py - Python Package Marker
üß† Core Business Logic & Rule Sets
The engine contains 3 main rule categories:

1. Eligibility Rules:
"eligibility_rules": {
    "min_policy_age_days": 30,           # Policy must be active for 30+ days
    "max_claim_amount": 100000,          # Maximum claimable amount
    "excluded_claim_types": ["flood", "earthquake", "war"],
    "required_documents": ["claim_form", "police_report", "photos"]
}


2. Coverage Rules
"coverage_rules": {
    "medical": {
        "outpatient_coverage": True,
        "inpatient_coverage": True,
        "max_benefit": 50000,      # $50k max medical coverage
        "deductible": 500          # $500 medical deductible
    },
    "surgical": {
        "coverage_enabled": True,
        "max_benefit": 100000,     # $100k max surgical coverage
        "deductible": 1000         # $1k surgical deductible
    }
}


3. Pricing Rules
"pricing_rules": {
    "base_rates": {"medical": 800, "surgical": 1200, "consultation": 300},
    "risk_multipliers": {"low": 0.8, "medium": 1.0, "high": 1.5},
    "discount_factors": {"multi_policy": 0.9, "good_health": 0.85}
}

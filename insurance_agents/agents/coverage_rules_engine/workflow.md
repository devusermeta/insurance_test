üîÑ Processing Workflow

Phase 1: Request Processing
# A2A message extraction
task_text = ""
if hasattr(message, 'parts') and message.parts:
    for part in message.parts:
        if hasattr(part, 'text'):
            task_text += part.text + " "




Phase 2: Claim Analysis  
# Extract claim amount using regex
amount_match = re.search(r'\$(\d+)', task_text)
claim_amount = float(amount_match.group(1)) if amount_match else 850.0

# Determine claim type
claim_type = "medical"
if 'surgical' in task_lower:
    claim_type = "surgical"
elif 'consultation' in task_lower:
    claim_type = "consultation"



Phase 3: Coverage Calculation
# Get coverage rules for claim type
coverage_rules = self.rule_sets["coverage_rules"].get(claim_type, medical_default)

# Apply deductible and limits
deductible = coverage_rules.get("deductible", 500)
max_benefit = coverage_rules.get("max_benefit", 50000)
covered_amount = min(claim_amount - deductible, max_benefit)
coverage_percentage = (covered_amount / claim_amount) * 100



Phase 4: Decision Making
result = {
    "claim_type": claim_type,
    "claim_amount": claim_amount,
    "deductible": deductible,
    "max_benefit": max_benefit,
    "covered_amount": max(covered_amount, 0),
    "coverage_percentage": round(coverage_percentage, 2),
    "eligibility": "approved" if covered_amount > 0 else "denied"
}


üèóÔ∏è Advanced Features (FastAPI Version)
1. Comprehensive Coverage Evaluation
async def _evaluate_coverage(self, request: CoverageEvaluationRequest) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # 6-step evaluation process:
    # 1. Check policy status
    # 2. Apply business rules  
    # 3. Check exclusions
    # 4. Calculate approved amount
    # 5. Make final decision
    # 6. Store results



2. Policy Status Validation
async def _check_policy_status(self, customer_id: str, policy_type: str):
    # Validates:
    # - Policy active/expired/suspended
    # - Coverage limits by policy type
    # - Premium payment status
    # - Effective dates



3. Business Rules Engine
async def _apply_business_rules(self, claim_data: Dict[str, Any]):
    # Applies rules for:
    # - High value claims (>$25k) ‚Üí Manual review
    # - Frequent claimants ‚Üí Increased scrutiny  
    # - Late reporting ‚Üí Apply penalty
    # - Claim type specific rules



4. Exclusions Processing
async def _check_exclusions(self, request: CoverageEvaluationRequest):
    # Checks for:
    # - Racing activities (full exclusion)
    # - Commercial use on personal policy
    # - Pre-existing conditions (partial exclusion)


5. Advanced Coverage Calculation
async def _calculate_approved_amount(self, claim_amount, deductible, coverage_limit, rule_results):
    # Calculation steps:
    # 1. Start with claim amount
    # 2. Subtract deductible  
    # 3. Apply coverage limits
    # 4. Apply rule-based adjustments (penalties)
    # 5. Apply exclusion reductions

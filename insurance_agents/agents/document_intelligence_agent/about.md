üìÑ Document Intelligence - Complete Deep Dive
üìÅ File Structure & Purpose
The Document Intelligence agent consists of 5 key files:

1. __main__.py - A2A Server Entry Point (123 lines)
Purpose: Sets up the A2A server infrastructure for document intelligence processing.

Key Features:

Runs on port 8003 (configurable)
Uses the fixed executor (DocumentIntelligenceExecutorFixed)
Defines 4 core skills: Document Analysis, Text Extraction, Damage Assessment, Form Recognition


2. document_intelligence_executor_fixed.py - A2A Compatible Business Logic (200 lines)
Purpose: The main A2A-compatible executor that handles document processing.

Key Responsibilities:

A2A Protocol Implementation - Inherits from AgentExecutor
Document Analysis - Processes document content intelligently
Text Extraction - Extracts structured data from documents
Medical Code Recognition - Identifies diagnosis and procedure codes


3. document_intelligence_executor.py - Duplicate of Fixed Version
Purpose: Identical to the fixed version (backup/alternative)

4. document_intelligence_agent.py - Comprehensive FastAPI Implementation (449 lines)
Purpose: Full-featured FastAPI-based implementation with advanced document processing.

5. __init__.py - Python Package Marker
üß† Core Document Processing Logic

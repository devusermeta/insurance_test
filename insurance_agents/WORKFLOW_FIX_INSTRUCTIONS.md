üîß FIXING ORCHESTRATOR WORKFLOW ISSUES
==========================================

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. ‚ùå Orchestrator is still running old code with 'start_workflow' error
2. ‚ùå JSON-RPC validation errors in requests  
3. ‚ùå Dashboard port mismatch in tests

SOLUTION STEPS:
===============

STEP 1: RESTART ORCHESTRATOR
----------------------------
1. Stop the current orchestrator (Ctrl+C in the orchestrator terminal)
2. Restart with: python agents/claims_orchestrator/__main__.py

STEP 2: VERIFY DASHBOARD RUNNING
--------------------------------
1. Ensure dashboard is running on port 3000
2. If not running: python start_dashboard.py

STEP 3: TEST THE FIXED WORKFLOW
-------------------------------
1. Run: python test_workflow_fix.py
2. This should now work without the 'start_workflow' error

STEP 4: TEST VIA DASHBOARD
-------------------------
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Click "Process" on any claim
3. Check the "Processing Steps" section for workflow visualization

WHAT WAS FIXED:
===============
‚úÖ Corrected workflow_logger.start_workflow() ‚Üí workflow_logger.start_claim_processing()
‚úÖ Corrected workflow_logger.complete_workflow() ‚Üí workflow_logger.log_completion()
‚úÖ Fixed dashboard API endpoint from /api/api/processing-steps ‚Üí /api/processing-steps  
‚úÖ Updated JavaScript to load processing steps instead of activity logs
‚úÖ Fixed test script to use proper A2A JSON-RPC format
‚úÖ Corrected dashboard port in test (5000 ‚Üí 3000)

EXPECTED RESULT:
===============
After restarting the orchestrator, you should see:
‚Ä¢ No more 'start_workflow' errors
‚Ä¢ Orchestrator actually calls other agents (intake_clarifier, document_intelligence, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Processing steps appear in the dashboard
‚Ä¢ Complete workflow tracking from discovery to final decision

The key issue was that the orchestrator was still running the old code. Once restarted, it should work correctly with the workflow logging fixes.

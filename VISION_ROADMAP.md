"""

# 🎯 VISION ROADMAP - NEXT STEPS

## ✅ COMPLETED MILESTONES

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ DONE
- ✅ Azure Document Intelligence integration with real credentials
- ✅ LLM-based intelligent document extraction (GPT-4o)
- ✅ A2A agent communication framework
- ✅ Cosmos DB integration with exact document formats
- ✅ Complete agent workflow: Orchestrator → Coverage Rules → Document Intelligence → Intake Clarifier

### Phase 2: Smart Extraction ✅ DONE
- ✅ Dynamic document processing (handles any format)
- ✅ Intelligent field extraction using Azure OpenAI
- ✅ Fallback pattern-based extraction for reliability
- ✅ Support for discharge summaries, medical bills, and memos

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Phase 3: Real-World Integration)

### Step 1: End-to-End Workflow Testing 📋
**Priority: HIGH | Timeline: 1-2 days**
- [ ] Start all 4 agents simultaneously
- [ ] Test complete orchestrator → coverage → document → intake flow
- [ ] Process real claim documents through the pipeline
- [ ] Verify Cosmos DB document creation in both containers

### Step 2: MCP Server Setup 🗄️
**Priority: HIGH | Timeline: 1 day**
- [ ] Start Cosmos DB MCP server for database operations
- [ ] Test MCP tool execution (cosmos_query, cosmos_upsert)
- [ ] Verify agent can read from claim_details and write to extracted_patient_details

### Step 3: Real Document Processing 📄
**Priority: MEDIUM | Timeline: 2-3 days**
- [ ] Create test insurance documents (discharge summaries, bills, memos)
- [ ] Upload to Azure Storage and get public URLs
- [ ] Process through Azure Document Intelligence + LLM pipeline
- [ ] Validate extraction accuracy vs manual review

## 🔄 PHASE 4: WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION (Week 2)

### Step 4: Claims Orchestrator Enhancement 🎭
- [ ] Implement business rule routing (eye/dental/general claims)
- [ ] Add claim validation and preprocessing
- [ ] Integrate with coverage rules engine results
- [ ] Add workflow logging and error handling

### Step 5: Coverage Rules Engine Integration ⚖️
- [ ] Test coverage rules evaluation with real policies
- [ ] Validate bill amount limits ($1000 eye, $500 dental, $2000 general)
- [ ] Implement pre-authorization checks
- [ ] Add policy validation logic

### Step 6: Intake Clarifier A2A Communication 🤝
- [ ] Complete A2A integration between document intelligence and intake clarifier
- [ ] Test agent-to-agent message passing
- [ ] Implement clarifier response processing
- [ ] Add human-in-the-loop for complex cases

## 🎯 PHASE 5: PRODUCTION READINESS (Week 3-4)

### Step 7: Error Handling & Monitoring 🔍
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling in all agents
- [ ] Logging and monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Alert system for failed claims
- [ ] Performance metrics and SLA tracking

### Step 8: Scalability & Performance 📈
- [ ] Load testing with multiple concurrent claims
- [ ] Optimize LLM extraction costs and speed
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Agent horizontal scaling preparation

### Step 9: Security & Compliance 🔒
- [ ] PHI data encryption and security
- [ ] Audit logging for compliance
- [ ] Access control and authentication
- [ ] HIPAA compliance validation

## 🌟 PHASE 6: ADVANCED FEATURES (Month 2)

### Step 10: Enhanced Intelligence 🧠
- [ ] Multi-document claim correlation
- [ ] Fraud detection using AI
- [ ] Predictive claim processing
- [ ] Automated prior authorization

### Step 11: Integration Ecosystem 🔗
- [ ] Insurance provider API integration
- [ ] Electronic health records (EHR) connectivity
- [ ] Payment processing integration
- [ ] Customer portal development

### Step 12: Analytics & Insights 📊
- [ ] Claims processing analytics dashboard
- [ ] Business intelligence reporting
- [ ] Cost analysis and optimization
- [ ] Predictive analytics for claim outcomes

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS
